**Project Status**
- Impemented basic koi fish with swimming animations
- Implemented water volume with ripples generated on click
- Implemented scene lighting and shaders for realistic water

**Project Overview**

The Vision: I want to build an interactive 3D koi pond where users can click on the pond to create ripples and feed the fish. The koi will react naturally to user interactions, moving away from or dodging ripples and moving towards dropped food.

**Project Schedule**

Week 1: Research and gather resources for low-poly koi models and water textures. Begin basic setup of the 3D environment using Three.js.

Week 2: Implement the koi fish with basic swimming animations. Set up the interactive water surface to respond to clicks with basic ripple effects.

Week 3: Add interactive behaviors such as fish moving away from ripples and swimming towards food when dropped into the pond.

Week 4: Finalize the user interface for dropping food and creating ripples. Polish the graphics, add ambient sounds, and prepare the project presentation.

**Project Technical Requirements**

I'll use Three.js rendering the 3D environment, fish, and interactive elements. 

Free low-poly models for the koi fish, I really don't want to have to make them myself. I'm bad at art. 

I'll need to Implement a simple physics algorithm to simulate water ripples when the pond is clicked. This could use a mesh deformation (TBD)

I'll also need to make a simple artificial intelligence for the koi fish so they react to interactions. 

I want a simple user interface that allows users to interact with the fish food, maybe a still frame animated food bucket?

**Things that would be cool**

Audio - Pond sound effects, nature SFX, etc..

Better shaders - realistic shadows

Pond props - things like leaves or lily pads that block light or interaction?

Environment settings - change the map surrounding the koi pond. Winter version?
